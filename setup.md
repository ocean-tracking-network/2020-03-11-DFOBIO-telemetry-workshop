## Requirements

### R version: 3.6.x or newer and RStudio

Open RStudio and run this install script. It's best to run it line by line instead of all at once in case there are errors.

<b>Note:</b> When running through the installs, you may encounter a prompt asking you to upgrade dependent packages. Choosing Option `3: None`, works in most situations and will prevent upgrades of packages you weren't explicitly looking to upgrade.
```r
